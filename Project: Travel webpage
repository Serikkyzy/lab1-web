        <p class="hi"><strong>Medeu</strong> is the world's largest high-altitude complex for winter sports with the largest area of an artificial ice field — 10.5 thousand m2. <strong>The high mountains</strong> and the purest mountain water for pouring ice contribute to achieving high results in speed skating, over <strong>200 world</strong> records have been set here for all distances among men and women. The Alma-Ata ice rink was nicknamed the <em>"factory of records".</em> It is a state monument of urban planning and architecture of national significance.</p>
        
        <h3>Shymbulak</h3>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Новая_гондольная_линия_Медео-Шымбулак._8-местная_кабина..JPG/1200px-Новая_гондольная_линия_Медео-Шымбулак._8-местная_кабина..JPG" alt="shym" width="250">
        <p class="hi">Favorable natural conditions attract <em>tourists, mountaineers, and skiers</em> to this area with accessible terrain, allowing you to lay ski trails with a height difference of <strong>900-1000 m.</strong> In this regard, since 1954, the ski sports base <strong>"Cimbulak"</strong>began to function here.

        <p class="hi"><strong>Big Almaty Lake</strong>, or BAO for short, is a picturesque lake <em>20 kilometers</em> from Almaty. The reservoir is located near the state border of <strong>Kyrgyzstan,</strong> but no special passes are required to visit-and the millions of tourists who have visited here are the best proof of this. BAO is hidden in a mountainous area with landscapes of indescribable beauty and delicious air filled with the aroma of fragrant herbs and <strong>the freshness of the snow-capped peaks of the Trans-Ili Alatau.</strong>
            
        </p>
        <h4>why Almaty? </h4>
        <p>Over the past few years, the cultural life of Alma-Ata has been experiencing a real flourishing. <strong>Theaters, festivals, galleries, conceptual</strong> spaces-there is an option for any audience. You should start exploring classical art at the Kasteev State Museum, where you can find not only collections of <em>Central Asian artists, but also halls with Russian, Western European and Eastern art.</em> Ballet and opera lovers should visit the Abay Opera and Ballet Theater already mentioned.
